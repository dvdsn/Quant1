1. If we type in R the following:

N <- 10000
x <- rnorm(N, mean=0, sd=1)

then the standard error for these samples should be approximately:

a. 0
b. 10000
c. 0.01
d. 1


2. One goal of a Bayesian data analysis is to:

a. Exclude outliers (i.e., data points that do not follow the general trend of the data)
b. Identify the credibility of parameter values in a descriptive model of a dataset
c. To find which pairs of parameter values are significantly different from each other
d. Identify the most-likely data values 


3. What does is mean if we say that an MCMC chain is "clumpy"?  Recall that an MCMC chain is a single simulation run for a parameter or group of parameters from the posterior distribution of a model.

a. When the prior is not conjugate with the posterior.
b. The different chains in the simulation run have mixed well.
c. The simulated parameter values are evenly distributed over the possible parameter values.
d. Many of the simulated values are similiar, reducing the effective sample size (ESS).
